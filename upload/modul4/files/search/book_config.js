Meanwhile, Ollivander (John Hurt), the Wandmaker warns Harry that he won't stand a\u000d\u000achance with Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) who has the Elder Wand. They arrived in Gringotts, Hermione (Emma Watson) disguised as Bellatrix (Helena Bonham Carter), using a\u000d\u000aPolyjuice Potion, Ron (Rupert Grint) disguised as a random wizard while Harry and Griphook go under the Invisibility Cloak. With the help of Imperius curse, they manage to\u000d\u000aget to the carts that take them down to the vaults, but when their cover is blown, Gringotts security attacks them. They manage to get to Lestrange's vault and find the\u000d\u000aHorcrux, Helga Hufflepuff's Cup, at which Griphook betrays them and flees with the sword yelling \"Thieves! Thieves!\" Harry grabs the Horcrux and the trio escape using a\u000d\u000acaptive dragon. As they swim ashore of a lake, after jumping off the dragon, Harry has a vision about Voldemort receiving the news that the Horcrux was stolen. Harry sees\u000d\u000athat Voldemort is angry and scared. Voldemort kills the goblins,including Griphook, that bring him the news. Harry also sees that the next Horcrux is related to Rowena \u000d\u000aRavenclaw, and is in Hogwarts castle.\u000d\u000aThe three Apparate to Hogsmeade in hopes of sneaking into the school but a Caterwauling charm is set off that warns the Death Eaters of the trio's arrival. They are saved by\u000d\u000aAberforth Dumbledore (Ciar\u00e1n Hinds), Albus's brother, who Harry has seen through the mirror that he has. The trio use a passageway to Hogwarts provided by Aberforth, with\u000d\u000aNeville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) leading the way. The group arrives at the Room of Requirement where Dumbledore's Army made a resistance from Snape's regime. As\u000d\u000aheadmaster, Snape (Alan Rickman) has turned Hogwarts into a lifeless prison. Harry confronts him in front of the entire school by saying, \"How dare you stand where he\u000d\u000astood. Tell them how it happened that night. How you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you, and killed him\" (referring to Albus Dumbledore). Minerva McGonagall \u000d\u000a(Maggie Smith) intervenes and fights Severus, who flees to his master. Meanwhile, Voldemort has summoned his army and surrounds Hogwarts.\u000d\u000aMcGonagall and the other Hogwarts staff made a barrier to keep the school safe from any attack. Hermione and Ron go to the Chamber of Secrets to get a basilisk fang\u000d\u000a(which can destroy Horcruxes), destroy Hufflepuff's Cup, and abruptly kiss. Harry, with the help of Rowena Ravenclaw's ghost daughter, Helena, finds out that the Ravenclaw \u000d\u000aDiadem was hidden, by Voldemort, in the Room of Requirement. He goes there, but is confronted by Malfoy and friends. When one of Malfoy's cohorts creates an unstoppable \u000d\u000afire (and perishes due to it), Harry, Ron and Hermione rush to escape on brooms. They save Malfoy (Tom Felton) and his other friend on the way. They destroy the diadem \u000d\u000ausing a basilisk fang. Voldemort uses the Elder Wand to destroy the shield around Hogwarts.\u000d\u000aVoldemort and Snape then meet in the boat house, where Voldemort tells Snape that the Elder Wand is not truly his, because he is not the master of it; that Snape is the\u000d\u000amaster of the wand because Snape killed Dumbledore, the previous master. So, Voldemort attacks Snape, and then orders Nagini to kill him.\u000d\u000aMeanwhile, Harry had been looking into Voldemort's mind to see where he was, and so knew that he was in the boathouse. Harry, Ron and Hermione witness all of this, and\u000d\u000awhen Voldemort disapparates, go into the boathouse. Snape cries a tear of memories, and comments on how Harry has his mother's eyes, and dies.\u000d\u000aVoldemort then speaks into the minds of every person in the area. He commands his forces to retreat so that the fighters at Hogwarts can dispose of their dead with dignity. \u000d\u000aHe then tells Harry that, unless he gives himself up in the Forbidden Forest, Voldemort will kill everyone who stands in his way.\u000d\u000aHarry, Ron, and Hermione go back to the castle and find that Lupin (David Thewlis), Tonks (Natalia Tena), and Fred (James Phelps) have all died. Harry goes to the\u000d\u000aHeadmaster's office, where he uses the Pensieve to view Snape's memories. Harry learns that Snape has been on the good side ever since Voldemort decided to kill Lily Potter \u000d\u000a(Harry's mother). Snape loved Lily almost his entire life, and promised to do anything for Dumbledore as long as he protected her. Then, when she was murdered, Snape \u000d\u000apromised to protect Harry in her place. We learn that Dumbledore had told Snape to kill him, as he would die soon anyway. We then learn that Harry is a Horcrux. Voldemort \u000d\u000aaccidentally created one that fateful night at Godric's Hollow. For this reason, Harry must die.\u000d\u000aHarry then goes to the Forbidden Forest and opens the snitch (by saying I am ready to die). The Resurrection Stone appears inside the snitch, and Harry uses it to bring back\u000d\u000ahis deceased loved ones. Harry faces Voldemort who uses the killing curse to kill Harry.\u000d\u000aHarry wakes up and talks with Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) in a 'heaven-like\" place. They talk a little, and Dumbledore says that Voldemort actually killed the bit of his soul\u000d\u000athat was in Harry, and not Harry himself. So, Harry decides to go back to the Forbidden Forest (his body was always there, but his consciousness was not).\u000d\u000aVoldemort has Narcissa Malfoy (Helen McCrory) check if Harry is alive. When she reaches Harry, she finds that he is alive, and asks Harry quietly if Draco is still alive. Harry \u000d\u000anods, and she pronounces him dead.\u000d\u000aBelieving that he is truly dead, Voldemort's army marches down to the defenseless Hogwarts while Harry is being carried by the tied Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). Voldemort \u000d\u000atorments the students and staff as they are now vulnerable and he's ready for anyone who wants to join him. Neville then gives a moving speech in which he says that\u000d\u000aalthough Harry is dead, the fight is not over. He then gets the sword of Gryffindor from the sorting hat. Harry reveals himself to be alive and casts a spell to Voldemort and his\u000d\u000aarmy. Many of the other Death Eaters flee, including the Malfoy family. Battle ensues inside the castle, and Harry and Voldemort face off and continuously cast spells at each\u000d\u000aother. On the other hand, Hermione and Ron try to kill the last Horcrux, Nagini. However, they fail to do so. However, when the snake is about to kill them, Neville kills it by\u000d\u000adecapitating its head using the sword of Gryffindor.\u000d\u000aHarry and Voldemort cast spells at each other, and Voldemort's killing curse backfires, and kills him, as the Elder wand flies to Harry. Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that\u000d\u000aDraco was master of the wand, not Snape, because Draco disarmed Dumbledore before Snape killed him. Then, at Malfoy Manor, Harry disarmed Draco, making Harry the\u000d\u000atrue master of the wand. Harry then snaps the wand in two, and throws it away forever.\u000d\u000a19 years later, Harry and Ginny (Bonnie Wright) are now parents and are guiding Albus Severus Potter and their other children into platform 9 3/4. When Albus is nervous\u000d\u000aabout being sorted into Slytherin, Harry reveals to him that the sorting hat will take your opinion into account. The Potters meet up with Ron and Hermione (who are married) \u000d\u000awho then watch as their kids ride away on Hogwarts express.\u000d\u000aSinopsis","Premis adalah rangkuman film\u000d\u000ayang dapat diceritakan dalam\u000d\u000a1 kalimat,\u000d\u000asinopsis adalah ringkasan \u000d\u000acerita dalam film yang disusun \u000d\u000asecara berurutan\u000d\u000aPremis \u000d\u000atidak sama dengan\u000d\u000aSinopsis","\u201cScript atau Screenplay, adalah naskah \u000d\u000atertulis yang dibuat oleh screenwriter \u000d\u000auntuk keperluan membuatfilm, \u000d\u000aanimasi atau media lainnya.\u201d\u000d\u000aScript","Contoh Script:","Contoh Script:","Bahan bacaan:\u000d\u000ahttps://www.studiobinder.com/blog/how-to-write-a-screenplay/","Storyboard\u000d\u000a\u201cSekumpulan gambar \u000d\u000aatau sketsa yang\u000d\u000adisusun berurutan untuk \u000d\u000amenggambarkan \u000d\u000asekuens dalam film, \u000d\u000aanimasi, atau media \u000d\u000ainteraktif lainnya.\u201d","Storyboard Format \u000d\u000aStoryboard:\u000d\u000a1.
